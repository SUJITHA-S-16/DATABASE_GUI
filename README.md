## STORE AND RETRIEVE DATA:
In this project we have to create a GUI to store address into database and a second GUI to retrieve data from the database

## Technologies Used:
•	Python
•	Tkinter
•	MySql

## Approach:
1.	In First GUI , Get the details from  the user.
2.	Store the details in MySql Database.
3.	In Second GUI , By giving a single input we can retrieve the whole data which was  stored in the database.
   
## For example:
In this project , I have created the basic details of a person which include First name, Last name, Door No, Street Name, City, District, Pincode, Email-id, 
Aadhar No, Educational Qualification, Identification.Aadhar No is unique for every person,
So while giving the Aadhar No as input we can retrieve the full details about the particular person.
